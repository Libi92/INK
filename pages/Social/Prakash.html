<p align="justify" style="margin-top:10px;font-size:30px;margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px"><em>What does it take to be a doctor practicing in the remote tribal regions without easy access to proper medicine and technology? What does it take to run an orphanage for rescued animals which may have otherwise ended up as dinner for the local population? What does it take for a regular surgeon to perform cataract operation with just a book as a reference? And least of all, what does it take to be Baba Amte&rsquo;s son? In this Q&amp;A with INK Curator Lakshmi Pratury, Magsaysay awardee Prakash Amte answers these questions and more.</em></p>

He has first hand experience in hand rearing of wild-life animals from leoprads to huge bears,even the deadliest snakes have been befriended by him.

      Way back in 1970 Lt. Baba urged his sons to come for a picnic in dandakaranya forest. Prakash accompanied his visionary father Lt. Baba Amte into the dense forests of bhamragad. Moved by the extreme poverty, exploitation, illiteracy and malnuitrition Baba decided to start a project for tribal development. At that time Prakash was young and freshly graduated; seeing his aged father's enthusiasm and dedication, he promised Baba to join him in his mission. This trip was a turning point in Prakash's life. Shortly after, he was joined by his young and able physician wife Mandakini.</p>
