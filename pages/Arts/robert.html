      <em>While playing for the homeless and mentally ill, violinist with the LA Philharmonic Robert Vijay Gupta realized that music can speak when words fail. With a parallel interest and training in neuroscience, Robert is passionate about discovering more about how music affects the brain. Robert talks about the special bond he shares with Nathaniel Ayers, the brilliant schizophrenic musician featured in the movie 'The Soloist', and his mission to light the fire of music in the darkest corner of the human soul.</em></p>

    <p align="justify" style="font-size:25px;margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px"><strong>Robert Vijay Gupta</strong><strong> </strong><br>
    Musical activist, violinist</p>
    <p align="justify" style="font-size:25px;margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px"><br>
      Violinist Robert Vijay Gupta joined the Los Angeles  Philharmonic in June 2007 at the age of 19.</p>
    <p align="justify" style="font-size:25px;margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px">Before joining the orchestra, Robert received a  Master&rsquo;s degree in Music from Yale University and a Bachelor&rsquo;s degree in  biology from Marist College. Parallel to his undergraduate studies in biology,  he attended the Manhattan School of Music and the Juilliard School of Music,  Pre-College Division. His principal teachers have included Glenn Dicterow, Ani  Kavafian, and Isaac Stern.</p>
    <p align="justify" style="font-size:25px;margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px">Robert made his solo debut at the age of eleven in Tel  Aviv with the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra under the baton of Zubin Mehta. He  has performed as a soloist with the New York Philharmonic, the Japan  Philharmonic Orchestra, and the Bombay Symphony Orchestra among many others. He  has also performed widely as a chamber musician and recitalist on an  international scale since the age of eight, and frequently appears on the  Philharmonic&rsquo;s Chamber Music Society and Green Umbrella new music series.  Robert has also performed as a guest concertmaster with the Los Angeles Opera  under James Conlon and the Orquestra Comunitat de Valencia at the Palau de Les  Arts in Valencia, Spain under Mehta.</p>
    <p align="justify" style="font-size:25px;margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px">Robert curates and directs a free outreach concert  series for the homeless, veterans, and mentally ill on skid row in downtown Los  Angeles called The Street Symphony, which brings musical activism to underserved  communities throughout Southern California. The project aims to bring live  musical performance to audiences without access in order to remove the stigma  associated with homelessness and mental health.</p>
    <p align="justify" style="font-size:25px;margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px">Throughout his undergraduate course of study, Robert  held Research Assistant positions at CUNY Hunter College in New York City,  where he worked on spinal chord neuronal regeneration, and at the Harvard  Institutes of Medicine Center for Neurologic Diseases, where he studied the  biochemical pathology of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease. He is passionate about  discovering more about how music affects the brain, especially in neurological  disorders. Robert is a TED Senior Fellow.</p>
    <p align="justify" style="font-size:25px;margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px">Robert recorded his debut album in July 2011 with  Yarlung Records, in Walt Disney Concert Hall. The album includes solo violin  works by John Harbison, Eugene Ysa&yuml;e, and HIF Biber, as well as the premiere  recordings of LA Phil principal timpanist Joseph Pereira&rsquo;s Partita for Solo  Violin and Gupta&rsquo;s own composition upon the Indian raga &quot;Jaunpuri&quot;.  The album was recorded on the 1716 &ldquo;Milstein&rdquo; Stradivarius.</p>
    <p align="justify" style="font-size:25px;margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px">PERSONAL JOURNEY&nbsp;<br />
      In 2008, I met Nathaniel Ayers, a homeless, paranoid  schizophrenic man, that I have come to call a close friend, and certainly,  amongst my most effective teachers. Nathaniel studied musical performance at  the prestigious Juilliard School, where I would later attend, but he dropped  out after his diagnosis with mental illness, and lived homeless in Los Angeles  for 30 years. I became his violin teacher, and time after time, the music would  bring him back from the very brink of a schizophrenic episode. Nathaniel showed  me that music was medicine, that music was sanity.</p>
