    <p align="justify" style="font-size:25px;margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px">d'bi artist statement: I believe that being an artist comes with numerous responsibilities; one of which is being able to be held accountable for the work I produce. Coming from a dub poetic tradition &ndash; where you learn that art exists to reflect the socio-economic/cultural realities of the people witnessing art &ndash; I create with a specific social conscience and awareness in mind. My work explores themes of ethnicity, equality, cultural hybridity, social taboos, racism, sexism, homophobia, immigration and a host of other social justice issues. The foundation for this exploration is love. Coming from a fierce love, I believe that the art I create ultimately questions, answers, heals, and provides a space for people to get to know/love themselves and the society, responsibly. One aspect of my accountability is taking the work I create to younger members of our community in primary and secondary schools. Young people need rigorous activities geared towards their examination of their relationship to the society they live in. Consistent participation in art creation that reflects them is one such critical activity. In my workshops with young people I take note of issues around safety, and the herstorical/cultural realities of the students; paying close attention to providing a holistic, flexible and hands on approach, to the work that we do. -d&rsquo;bi.young anitafrika</p>
