<p align="justify" style="margin-top:10px;font-size:30px;margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px"><em>INK Fellow Nikhilesh Das demonstrates on stage  that 95% of oil pollution can be removed from water using three waste products:  human hair, bird feathers and sawdust. Nikhilesh was inspired to become an  environmental scientist at the young age of 12, when he realized that the oil  his mother put on his hair could also be used to clean oil pollution from  water.</em></p>

    Rural innovator</p>
    <p align="justify" style="font-size:25px;margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px"><br>
      Nikhilesh Das was awarded the fifth National  Grassroots Innovation Award by the President of India, Smt Pratibha Patil, for  his innovative research on controlling oil pollution in water. A student of  Cotton College (BSc in Physics), Das aims to pursue a career in nuclear physics  and bring the spirit of scientific innovation to students across India.</p>
    <p align="justify" style="font-size:25px;margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px">Das has been keenly interested in science since  childhood. When he was just in class six he made an herbal repellant for  cockroaches, which was quite effective. Throughout his school years he  represented his school in a number of science exhibitions, debate, quiz and  speech competitions, and won many prizes at the state level. &nbsp;Das invented  an innovative solution to control oil pollution using waste products. Through  experimentation, Das discovered that human hair, bird feathers, and sawdust are  all 95% effective at removing oil from water in clinical trials.</p>
    <p align="justify" style="font-size:25px;margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px">Das submitted his proposal to the NIF (National  Innovation Foundation), and in 2009 they selected his idea for the national  level Science Exhibition. They also recommended it for the highly prestigious  National Students Award. Das won the competition, and President Smt. Pratibha  Devi Singh Patil of India presented him with the award. In 2011, NIF and Das  applied to the Government of India for a patent on his inventions.</p>
    <p align="justify" style="font-size:25px;margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px">Das&nbsp;is currently pursuing a degree physics from  Cotton College Guwahati.</p>
    <p align="justify" style="font-size:25px;margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px">PERSONAL JOURNEY</p>
    <p align="justify" style="font-size:25px;margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px">When I traveled to New Delhi to receive the National  Student&rsquo;s Award from the President of India, I came in touch with some of the  most fascinating people I have met in my life--the other innovators who were  awarded by NIF for their outstanding works on Science and Technology. I was  moved by seeing those people, the majority of whom were college and school dropouts  yet had made some of the most fascinating things I&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>
