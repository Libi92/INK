    <p align="justify" style="font-size:25px;margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px"><br>
      Madhumita Halder is the founder of MadRat Games,  creators of the World&rsquo;s first Indian Language word game &ndash; Aksharit  (www.aksharit.com). She graduated in Computer Science from IIT Bombay and being  an artist at heart, worked for a FX studio. However her creative energies not  finding room for expression in the corporate world, she chose to work with  children. She subsequently taught middle school children at an alternate  education center for 4 years.</p>
    <p align="justify" style="font-size:25px;margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px">She explored science through games, play and  activities with the children. That&rsquo;s when the tremendous potential that Play  had in learning became abundantly clear. With the vision to unleash this  potential that Play holds to engage learners through fun, she co-founded MadRat  Games. Their flagship game Aksharit is now ready in 11 major Indian Languages  and has been adopted by more than 2500 schools across the country. Nokia, Intel  and Google have partnered with MadRat Games and launched Aksharit on half a  million devices.</p>
    <p align="justify" style="font-size:25px;margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px">PERSONAL JOURNEY</p>
    <p align="justify" style="font-size:25px;margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px">By my first job I had everything that I had learnt is  needed for contentment, yet I felt lost and a search for my purpose in life  began. As the question became intense, disillusionment grew and at this time a  friend advised me to read the Bhagwad Geeta (which honestly sounded clich&eacute;d  then) and it talked about how our self brings in emotions and prejudices to our  sensory experiences and I knew a switch in me had turned on. I suddenly saw the  world for what it was, the societal conditioning dropped and my exploration  began.</p>
