<p align="justify" style="margin-top:10px;font-size:30px;margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px"> 
      <em>John Frame's stop motion animation films of small-scale characters built from wood and found objects are visual poetic masterpieces. They explore the old questions of life such as where did we come from, what do we do while we're here, and what happens when we leave. Frame recounts his personal evolution as an artist to reveal the journey that culminated in the startling and provocative art he produces today.</em></p>

    <p align="justify" style="font-size:25px;margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px"><strong>John Frame</strong><strong> </strong><br>
    Sculptor, filmmaker, composer</p>
    <p align="justify" style="font-size:25px;margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px"><br>
      John Frame has been making sculpture in the Southern  California area of the United States since the early 1980s; his work has been  exhibited extensively in the US as well as in Europe, Japan, and Taiwan. From  the beginning of his career, he has undertaken an in-depth exploration of the  human condition. Those who review Frame's work frequently suggest that its  appeal lies in his propensity to probe the deep questions of life without  arriving at easy answers. One critic captures this tension thus: &ldquo;In Frame's  work the meaning eludes us while the search for meaning captivates us.&rdquo;</p>
    <p align="justify" style="font-size:25px;margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px">John twice has been the recipient of grants from the  National Endowment for the Arts and received the New Talent Award from the Los  Angeles County Museum of Art. In 1995 he was awarded the J. Paul Getty Museum&rsquo;s  Individual Artist Fellowship. He received an Honorary Doctor of Arts degree  from Cornish College of the Arts in Seattle in 2009.</p>
    <p align="justify" style="font-size:25px;margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px">A survey of the artist&rsquo;s work was held at the Los  Angeles County Museum of Art in 1992. In 2005 the Long Beach Museum of Art  organized a retrospective exhibition, &ldquo;Enigma Variations: The Sculpture of John  Frame, 1980 to 2005.&rdquo; In 2011 the Huntington Library, Art Collections and  Botanical Gardens, in San Marino, California, mounted a major exhibition,  &ldquo;Three Fragments of a Lost Tale: Sculpture and Story by John Frame&rdquo; The  exhibition consisted of more than thirty-five pieces of sculpture, a theatrical  stage, multiple sets and a short animated film using the artist&rsquo;s works that  had been specifically designed for that purpose. Frame also created the score  for the film.</p>
    <p align="justify" style="font-size:25px;margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px">His work can be found in more than 300 public and  private collections, including the permanent collections of the Los Angeles  County Museum of Art, the Orange County Museum of Art, the Long Beach Museum of  Art, the Palm Springs Desert Museum, the Renwick Gallery of American Art at the  Smithsonian Institution, and the University of Southern California. In 2011 he  was invited to guest curate an exhibition of rarely seen works by William Blake  at the Huntington Library in San Marino, California.</p>
    <p align="justify" style="font-size:25px;margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px">Frame has been artist in residence, visiting artist,  or guest lecturer at more than 50 museums, universities, and art-related  institutions around the United States. He has also taught at the University of  California at Los Angeles, Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, and at the  Claremont Graduate University. He lives and works in Wrightwood, California.</p>
    <p align="justify" style="font-size:25px;margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px">In the year 2000, after working for more than twenty  years as a successful sculptor, I found that I had arrived at what appeared to  be the end of my exploration of my chosen territory. After five years of failed  attempts to find my way into the next phase of my work, I finally gave up  completely and hopelessly. Almost immediately, I was awakened in the middle of  the night with a vision of a vast world complete with multiple characters,  scenes and a complete &ldquo;Tale.&rdquo; My journey since that day has been to bring that  world into this.</p>
