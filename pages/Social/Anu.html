<p align="justify" style="margin-top:10px;font-size:30px;margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px"><em>Anu Aga speaks candidly about managing personal egos, making life changes, and living and learning from death. Her humility and honest appraisal of her weaknesses are inspirational, and her bravery in the face of personal tragedy is instructional. Aga was Director and former Chairperson of Thermax, and steered Thermax to success for 15 years. With a standing ovation from the audience, Aga's life introspective is not to be missed.</em></p>

    <p align="justify" style="font-size:25px;margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px"><strong>Anu Aga</strong><strong> </strong><br>
      Business leader</p>
    <p align="justify" style="font-size:25px;margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px"><br>
      Anu Aga was the Chairperson of Thermax, an Indian engineering company providing energy-environment systems and solutions. She was instrumental in turning around the company and bringing it to its growth path. Anu retired in 2004 and is a Director on the Board of Thermax.</p>
    <p align="justify" style="font-size:25px;margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px">After graduating from St. Xavier&rsquo;s College, Anu did her post graduation degree at Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS). She was awarded a Fullbright Scholarship to study in the US for a short period.</p>
    <p align="justify" style="font-size:25px;margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px">She has been very active in various national and local associations. She had served as the Chairperson of the Confederation of Indian Industry&rsquo;s (CII) Western Region. She has written extensively and given talks on the subjects of corporate governance, corporate social responsibility, women empowerment and promoting the inherent diversity of Indian life.</p>
    <p align="justify" style="font-size:25px;margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px">Since her retirement, Anu has chosen to focus on education for the underprivileged. She is closely involved with Akanksha, an NGO which supplements the educational needs of children living in slums. In partnership with the city civic authority and Akanksha, Thermax Social Initiatives Foundation has adopted two municipal schools in Pune in Western India. She is on the Board of Teach for India, an initiative that attempts to bridge the inequity gap in education.</p>
    <p align="justify" style="font-size:25px;margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px">Currently, she is a member of the National Advisory Council under the Chairmanship of Mrs. Sonia Gandhi. The 14 member Committee advises the government on issues related to the underprivileged.</p>
    <p align="justify" style="font-size:25px;margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px">PERSONAL JOURNEY&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify" style="font-size:25px;margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px">After the sudden death of my husband, the Board appointed me as the Executive Chairperson of the Company. I felt very inadequate to accept this responsibility and kept telling myself that I did not deserve this position.</p>
    <p align="justify" style="font-size:25px;margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px">The journey that helped me very significantly was attending a Buddhist meditation programme called Vipassana. It helped me to confront my self-doubts and get in touch with my inner strength and centeredness. It also helped me in coming to terms with death. I have gained inner peace and learnt to be equanimous.</p>
