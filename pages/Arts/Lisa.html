      <em>Lisa Staprans's outlook towards designing homes changed when she was diagnosed with cancer seven years ago. Having designed a large house that was filled with things and people, she said she strangely felt empty and wondered what legacy was she going to leave behind for her two young boys. Soulful Design, as she calls it, is her way of giving back that will keep the user of a physical space grounded with compassion, music and laughter.</em></p>

    Designer</p>
    <p align="justify" style="font-size:25px;margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px"><br>
      Lisa Staprans has practiced interior design and  product design for 20 years. She travels the world for inspiration and to learn  and study other cultures, art, architecture and lifestyles. The book she is  currently writing,&nbsp;<em>The Soul of Design</em>, features art, interior  design, architecture, gardens, and other soulful spaces around the world.</p>
    <p align="justify" style="font-size:25px;margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px">Lisa earned a Bachelors degree in Fine Art from the  University of California at Berkeley, and later studied at the School of Visual  Arts and Parson&rsquo;s School of Design, both located in New York City. Her career  in design began in New York City working for large and small firms. In 1992 she  and her husband founded the company, Lisa Staprans Interior Design, currently  known as Staprans Design. Lisa&rsquo;s clients have homes in Virginia, New York,  Utah, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, and many places in California.</p>
    <p align="justify" style="font-size:25px;margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px">&ldquo;I entered college intent on becoming a fine artist.  By graduation I&rsquo;d become captivated by the idea of using interior design to  make a palpable difference in people&rsquo;s everyday lives. The best part is &mdash; I get  to collaborate with interesting, creative and inspiring people every day.  Sometimes it&rsquo;s a team of architects, contractors, artisans, craftspeople and,  of course, home owners. Other times it&rsquo;s a small group, just me, my project  manager, and the owners. Whatever the size of the team, it&rsquo;s a wonderful  feeling when we unite behind a vision to create a beautiful home.&rdquo;</p>
    <p align="justify" style="font-size:25px;margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px">&ldquo;I also have a growing passion for finding ways to  make the practice of sustainable consumption an integral part of our interior  design. I find fulfillment in working with artisans and firms that have  integrity and a sense of social responsibility. &ldquo;Green&rdquo; materials take first  preference, while reclaimed lumber and antiques add a sense of warmth and  history. I prefer products that are not mass-produced, but instead they are  made for individual spaces by individual artists. I support the small village  and family with my choices of where things are manufactured. If I use products  from other countries I strive to make sure that the people creating those  products are not using child labor or subjecting workers to inhumane  conditions.&rdquo;</p>
    <p align="justify" style="font-size:25px;margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px">Lisa frequently travels the globe, making yearly  visitis to her Latvian home on the Baltic Sea, always buying treasures for  projects and her small showroom in the Allied Arts Guild in Menlo Park. She  travels the world for inspiration and to learn and study other cultures, art,  architecture and lifestyles. The book she is currently writing,&nbsp;<em>The Soul of Design</em>, features art, interior design, architecture,  gardens, and other soulful spaces around the world.</p>
    <p align="justify" style="font-size:25px;margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px">PERSONAL JOURNEY&nbsp;<br />
My personal journey began when I was diagnosed with cancer 7 years ago with 2  young sons at home. I had been questioning my work and how I was making a difference  before I got sick. I wanted to leave a legacy for my sons so they would know  why I left home each day and traveled the country and parts of the world for my  work. Getting cancer helped me to realize that there is a much bigger purpose  to creating and living design: we can support indigenous cultures by supporting  their work through design and that we can make a difference in our communities  both at home and globally if we think about the cause and effect of how we  consume. This seed took root during a trip to India 5 years ago with Lakshmi  (the host of this wonderful conference) and a group of extraordinary women from  the Bay Area of California. Being in India helped me to see the humility in  humanity and the true difference we can make in someone&rsquo;s life through the  choices we make and support.</p>
